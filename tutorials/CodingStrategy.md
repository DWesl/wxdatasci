# Coding Strategy
Tips for beocoming a better programmer and coding stress-free!


1. If you have a deadline, don't procrastinate! It's difficult (and stressful) to write good code under time constraints. If you're stuck, this gives you time to take a break. Often, good ideas will come at a later time.

2. Google is your best friend! Almost all of the problems you encounter while coding have already been solved in one form or another, and the answer is online. StackOverflow is an excellent resource no matter what language you're using. Take a bit of time to identify your problem and come up with good search terms and you'll find plenty of helpful information online.

3. If you encounter an error, don't panic! Errors are inevitable, and the solution is often simple. Read the traceback carefully and determine which line(s) of code are causing the problem before pasting the entire traceback into google.
