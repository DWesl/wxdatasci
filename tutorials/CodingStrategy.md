# Coding Strategy
Tips for beocoming a better programmer and coding stress-free!


1. If you have a deadline, don't procrastinate! It's difficult (and stressful) to write good code under time constraints. If you're stuck, this gives you time to take a break. Often, good ideas will come at a later time.

2. Google is your best friend! Almost all of the problems you encounter while coding have already been solved in one form or another, and the answer is online. StackOverflow is an excellent resource no matter what language you're using. Take a bit of time to identify your problem and come up with good search terms and you'll find plenty of helpful information online.

3. If you encounter an error, don't panic! Errors are inevitable, and the solution is often simple. Read the traceback carefully and determine which line(s) of code are causing the problem before pasting the entire traceback into google.

4. Make frequent backups!  This can be as simple as saving a series of `myscript_v1.py`, `myscript_v2.py`, and so on every time you get a feature working, or as complicated as creating a git commit and pushing it to a server with an automated testing workflow.  Either way, if you accidentally break something, you can go back to an earlier working version.

5. Write simple example scripts using your proposed functions on simple data.  These can serve as basic documentation of how your code is supposed to work, in case someone else wants to use your code to solve their problem.  If the example scripts check the outputs, you can use them as a benchmark later if you try to make the code execute more quickly or in a different manner depending on inputs (for example, trying to fix nighttime estimates without breaking daytime estimates).

6. Write documentation as you go.  This can be a collection of comments just before functions or code blocks describing what problems you ran into trying to write them, where you found inspiration for answers, and what clever things you had to do to get things working.  Ideally the function name describes what it does, but you can write a longer description here as well.

7. If you find yourself doing the same thing over and over in different places in your code, separate it out into a function, so if you decide to do that thing differently, you only have to change it in one place.
